The example from the lesson with exchange rates must be finished
    The convert function is separate from the Price class
    The convert() function claims the data from the external resource (alphavantage)

Your personal Alphavantage API Key is claimed from ðŸ”— HERE: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

Since each conversion triggers the external API request I would like you to add logging for each call to the Alphavantage
    Logging means that you have the next file in your folder: logs.json
    Read about JSON ðŸ”—HERE: https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp
    The logs.json structure is next:

"results": [
    {...},
    {...},
    ...
]

If you compare the structure of the JSON file to Python data structures you have ARRAYS instead of LISTS and OBJECTS instead of DICTS.
So out of that: it has the results ARRAY on the top level which consists of OBJECTS
After the request has returned some response I want this ARRAY in the file to be augmented with new data of the next structure:

{
  "currency_from": ...,
  "currency_to": ...,
  "rate": ...,
  "timestamp": ...,
}

A time stamp could be in any representation you want but make sure that the initial value is taken from the datetime.now()
