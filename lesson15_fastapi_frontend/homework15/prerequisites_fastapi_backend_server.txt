Repeat the frontend from the last example that communicates with the Alphavantage API for claiming the rate.
In the lesson, we’ve done the communication for hardcoded values but currently,
you have to unify the interface and make it work for all the currencies.

Requirements:

- The request HTTP method is: POST

- Provide the source and destination currencies in the body for using those values on the backend’s side
for claiming the requested exchange rate.

- The exchange rate must be displayed on each button press.

- To not abuse the external API, please add the next functionality: if a user has called the API last 10 seconds
the backend server returns the cached value instead of requesting a new one.
The cached value could be a global variable in python.
