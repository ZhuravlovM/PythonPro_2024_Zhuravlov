Create a class Price (for more details take a look at the end of Lesson 9)

  class Price:
    def __init__(self, value: int, currency: str) -> None:
      self.value: int = value
      self.currency: str = currency

Acceptance criteria:
    If I create 2 instances of a Price class I want to do operations between them:
    add prices with the same currency
    do a subtraction of prices with the same currency

* Additional: operations between prices with different currencies:
    If price instances' currencies are different I want to apply a middle conversion
    CHF is a middle currency
    P.S. Middle conversion is described at the end of Lesson 9
    The resulting price must have a currency of the price that is on the left
